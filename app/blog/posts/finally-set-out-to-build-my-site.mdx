summary: "I've had the domain for a while but never got around to actually building the site. Now I finished the setup I had in mind."

For a long time I've had the domains set up and connected to either GitHub Pages
or a VPS somewhere, but never had much beyond a basic hello or, at worst, an incomplete site.

## Why now?

I don't know. I felt like I could set my mind on actually finishing this site so
I could continue building other apps afterwards. Possibly post something on here
once in a while.

This site is built with Next.js and uses MDX for the posts.
